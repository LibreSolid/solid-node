A framework to create parametrical mechanical projects with Free Software


* Free software: GNU Affero General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://solid-node.readthedocs.io.

Introduction
============

There are several technologies that allow the creation of parametric solids
using Free Software, namely OpenScad, CadQuery and Solid Python. When it comes
to mechanical projects, each technology has a different set of libraries available,
and each has its pros and cons. Whichever your choice, they all face limitations
soon. Solid Node proposes an architecture to organize mechanical projects so that
different technologies can be combined, relation between components can be tested,
and individual pieces can be rendered for optimization.

Quickstart
==========

Start by cloning `solid-seed <https://github.com/LibreSolid/solid-seed>_`.
Follow instructions from the README file there.

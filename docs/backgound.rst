Background
==========

SolidNode originated from the recognized need for durable, repairable, and sustainable consumer goods. It aims to address the prevalent problem of product disposability and the resulting environmental impact.

This project's inspiration derived from the insight that hardware, akin to software, possesses a source code. This notion led to the innovative concept of extending Copyleft principles to hardware. Within a Copyleft framework, the goal is that all producible objects could become open-source, fostering repairability and minimizing waste.

Managing mechanical projects with source code involves considerable complexity, especially when dealing with solids inherent to these projects. OpenScad, with its SolidPython layer, and CadQuery offer different approaches, each with their pros and cons and their distinct repositories of libraries to draw from. The necessity to select libraries from both worlds for complex projects, combined with overseeing real-time code modifications, optimizing performance, and conducting automated tests, calls for a more robust solution.

SolidNode is being developed to meet this need. Envisioned as a framework for hardware design, it aspires to amalgamate various tools and libraries into a unified whole. Drawing inspiration from Django's software development framework, SolidNode is being designed to streamline complexity and expedite the development process while endorsing open-source hardware.

Looking to the future, SolidNode aspires to be more than just a tool for managing current hardware projects. It aims to ensure the longevity of hardware source code. The future development roadmap includes the ambitious plan of creating a peer-to-peer tracking system, striving to maintain source code over potentially centuries-long hardware lifespans. Additionally, the roadmap envisions the implementation of a real-time collaboration system. This system, combined with the Affero General Public License, aims to enable seamless teamwork on hardware projects, thereby assuring that the development environment will remain free and open.

By integrating agile development processes with the Copyleft principle, SolidNode seeks to provide a robust framework for sustainable and open-source hardware design. It represents a purposeful and significant stride towards a future of more sustainable hardware production and usage.

Background
==========

A while ago I got interested in building a windmill to pump water in my garden. As I couldn't find an open source project, I started to build my own, using OpenScad.

I soon reached the limitations of developing mechanical projects in OpenScad, as rendered became so slow it got impossible to code. I then found out about Solid Python and CADQuery, and realized how fragmented the community is. I wanted my windmill to be Free Software, but couldn't make two gears to fit each other, because I couldn't find one Free Software library that could handle all my gears, and the only way would be to combine OpenScad with CADQuery.

With my full stack web development background, I realized that the web development frameworks I'm used to (Django, React and Angular) have implemented and matured framework patterns that can solve the bottlenecks of having a Free Software tool able to manage complex parametric mechanical projects. And then, SolidNode was born.

As I coded Solid Node, I thought about the environmental impact of closed source solids. Imagine how much plastic garbage is generated because parts get broken and maintenance is not available. And then, one idea emerged: once there's technology for Free Software solids, producing closed software plastic should one become an unnaceptable practice. With this idea, LibreSolid was born.

This is a pre-alpha package, and it's finally easy to demonstrate.

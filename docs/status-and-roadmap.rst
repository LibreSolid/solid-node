Project status
==============

This project has been developed and maintained by a single person so far, and as it is, it's pretty usable. It can already solve real bottlenecks in mechanical project development. It's still a bit far from 1.0 version, but the **current node API should not change** until there, so you're invited to use it in your next 3D printable Free Software project.

Roadmap
=======

  * A command to pack the project into a distributable with source and builds
  * Improve the web viewer with workplanes, rulers, camera angles, animation control, a test runner
  * A command to create a static website with docstrings, the viewer, source and build downloads
  * A FlexibleNode class to create objects that change shape over time, with keyframes for animation
  * Improve the builder to recover from errors

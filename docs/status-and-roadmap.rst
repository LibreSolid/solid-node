==============
Project status
==============

This project has been developed and maintained by a single person so far, and as it is, it's pretty usable. It can already solve real bottlenecks in mechanical project development. It's still a bit far from 1.0 version, but the **current node API should not change** until there.

Roadmap
=======

  * Improve the web viewer with workplanes, rulers, camera angles, animation control, etc
  * A "dist" command that packs the project into a distributable with source and builds
  * A "publish" command that creates a static website with docstrings, viewer, source and build downloads
  * Separate the watcher and builder internal processes to recover from errors

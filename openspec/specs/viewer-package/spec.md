# Viewer Package Specification

## Purpose

The reusable, React-free browser viewer shared by static exports and future
framework hosts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A host mounts the viewer and receives a handle

The viewer SHALL mount into a caller-supplied container against a published tree
document and resolve to a handle. The handle SHALL expose `dispose()` (stop
rendering, release resources and empty the container), `view()` (camera position
and orbit target), `reload()` (rebuild the document while preserving the view),
and the declared API version. Loading the viewer core SHALL NOT modify the
document; only an explicit mount may do so.

#### Scenario: A host unmounts a viewer

- **WHEN** a host calls `dispose()`
- **THEN** rendering stops, the container is empty, and no later frame or
  resize callback runs

#### Scenario: A host remounts and keeps the maker's viewpoint

- **WHEN** a host captures `view()`, disposes, and supplies that view to a new
  mount
- **THEN** the new viewer uses the captured camera and orbit target rather
  than fitting again

#### Scenario: A host refreshes a changed model in place

- **WHEN** a source document changes and the host calls `reload()`
- **THEN** the new tree renders while camera position and orbit target remain
  unchanged

#### Scenario: Loading the core mounts nothing

- **WHEN** a host loads the core without calling `mount()`
- **THEN** no element is created, document fetched, or container modified

### Requirement: One loader reads either published document

The viewer SHALL render either portable `manifest.json` or normal-build
`viewer.json`, reading their shared fields. The host supplies the document URL
and an optional mesh base; the base defaults to the document's directory. A
fetch or parse failure SHALL name the document and the reason.

#### Scenario: A build snapshot rooted elsewhere

- **WHEN** a host mounts a `viewer.json` with a mesh base unrelated to its
  document URL
- **THEN** models load from that base with the same tree, colours, and
  animation as the equivalent export

#### Scenario: A self-contained export

- **WHEN** a host mounts an export without supplying a mesh base
- **THEN** its model paths resolve beside the manifest and it renders

#### Scenario: An unreachable document

- **WHEN** the source document cannot be fetched
- **THEN** mounting fails with an error naming the document and failure

### Requirement: The host chooses how animation is presented

For a model with `$t` operations, the viewer SHALL present animation as an
always-visible inline play/pause and `0..1` timeline (`1/frames` step), the same
bar behind an initially collapsed accessible toggle, no controls, or externally
driven time with no controls. The host SHALL set initial time and autoplay.
Playback SHALL cycle every `frames / fps` seconds; scrubbing pauses it. Static
models SHALL present no controls.

#### Scenario: A shop floor hides the timeline until asked

- **WHEN** an animated model uses toggled presentation
- **THEN** the bar starts hidden behind a collapsed persistent toggle and the
  toggle reports its expanded state when activated

#### Scenario: A published export shows the bar

- **WHEN** an animated model uses inline presentation
- **THEN** play/pause and timeline are visible immediately

#### Scenario: A host drives time itself

- **WHEN** a host uses externally driven presentation and sets time
- **THEN** the viewer renders that pose with no controls

#### Scenario: A static model

- **WHEN** a model has no `$t` operation in any presentation mode
- **THEN** it creates no play/pause, timeline, or toggle

### Requirement: The camera fits the model unless the host restores a view

The viewer SHALL orient Z-up and, after meshes load, fit the model bounds with
orbit controls targeting its centre. A supplied view SHALL set position and
target instead, while near and far clipping continue to derive from bounds.

#### Scenario: A first look at a model

- **WHEN** a model mounts without a view
- **THEN** the whole model is framed and orbiting targets its centre

#### Scenario: A rebuild during a work session

- **WHEN** a model mounts with a supplied view
- **THEN** the camera is restored and the model is neither clipped nor beyond
  the far plane

### Requirement: Colour is inherited and falls back to a normal material

The viewer SHALL use a node colour or its nearest ancestor colour, and SHALL
use the framework's normal-based material when no colour is available.

#### Scenario: A part inherits its assembly's colour

- **WHEN** a node has no colour and an ancestor does
- **THEN** the part renders in the ancestor's colour

#### Scenario: A colourless assembly

- **WHEN** no node declares a colour
- **THEN** every model renders with the normal-based material

### Requirement: The host names the canvas for its own styles and assistive tools

The viewer SHALL apply a host-supplied CSS class, role, and accessible label to
the canvas. Absent a host choice, it SHALL add no such attributes.

#### Scenario: A shop floor labels the model view

- **WHEN** a host supplies a canvas class, role, and label
- **THEN** the canvas carries them for host styling and assistive tools

### Requirement: The viewer declares its API version

The package SHALL declare one API version, expose it on every mount handle and
the browser global, and make it readable without executing the bundle. It SHALL
be raised whenever the mount interface or handle changes incompatibly.

#### Scenario: A host checks compatibility before mounting

- **WHEN** a host reads the installed viewer API version
- **THEN** it obtains the package's single declared version without running a
  browser bundle

#### Scenario: A mounted viewer reports its version

- **WHEN** a host inspects a mount handle or the browser global
- **THEN** both report the same declared API version

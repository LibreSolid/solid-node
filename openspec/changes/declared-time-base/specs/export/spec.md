## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Manifest contract

The manifest SHALL retain the document name `manifest.json` and SHALL declare
`format: "solid-node-export"`, `animation: {fps, frames}`, a
`drivers` table, an `instructions` table, and a
`root` tree with the same observable schema and child-name behavior as the
normal-build `viewer.json`. When the exported root declares a time base the
`animation` object SHALL also carry numeric `loop`, the declared seconds of
machine time one turn of `$t` covers, and SHALL omit the key otherwise; the
browser-snapshot document SHALL publish `loop` under the same rule. `loop` is
additive within the current schema version — a consumer that does not read
it plays `frames / fps` as before — and `--fps` / `--frames` keep their
meaning as the timeline's playback resolution. A rigid node SHALL emit one
`model` reference and
stop recursion; a non-rigid node whose render result is a list or tuple SHALL
recurse into its children; a flexible leaf SHALL emit one `flexible` object
and stop recursion. Each node SHALL carry `name`, `type`, `color`,
`mtime`, and its operations as raw unevaluated expression strings so `$t`
animation is preserved verbatim. A rigid model reference SHALL remain rooted
beneath the export's `models/` directory and SHALL resolve to a copied artifact
so the export remains portable and self-contained. Changes to the shared tree
shape or operation serialization are breaking and MUST bump `version` and
update every producer and consumer of the shared schema together.

The document SHALL declare `version: 3` when the serialized tree contains at
least one flexible leaf, and `version: 2` otherwise, so a document without
flexible content stays byte-compatible with existing consumers and an old
consumer refuses only what it genuinely cannot render. Consumers SHALL accept
both versions.

#### Scenario: A declared time base is exported

- **WHEN** a root declaring `time = Time(loop=43200)` is exported
- **THEN** `manifest.json` carries `animation.loop == 43200` beside the
  requested `fps` and `frames`, its version is unchanged by the key, and its
  operations carry `$t` multiplied by the loop rather than a constant

#### Scenario: An undeclared root exports no loop

- **WHEN** a root declaring no time base is exported
- **THEN** `manifest.json`'s `animation` object has no `loop` key and is
  byte-identical to the manifest exported before this change

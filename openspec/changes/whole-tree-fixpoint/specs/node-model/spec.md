## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Template-method render lifecycle

The system SHALL control the node lifecycle through `assemble()`, which users
do not override: render → simulate (assemblies only) → validate → `as_scad` →
`generate_scad` → optional optimized STL import → apply queued operations.
`assemble()` SHALL be idempotent — the result is memoized and `render()` is
called at most once per instance. On an assembly the framework SHALL run
`simulate()` after `render()` ONCE PER ENUMERATION of the tree, under the
current binding: the `render()` that begins an enumeration drives the
simulate phase of every assembly in the subtree it renders, parents
before children, before it returns, and a later `render()` reached by the
walk's own descent within that same enumeration SHALL return the
children at rest without running that assembly's phase again. Every
assembly's motion is therefore in place before the walk reads any of the
tree's geometry. Users override `render()` and `simulate()`, never
`assemble()`.

#### Scenario: Assemble is memoized

- **WHEN** `assemble()` is called twice on the same instance
- **THEN** `render()` runs only once and the cached result is returned

#### Scenario: Optimized import of cached STL

- **WHEN** a node has `optimize = True`, is rigid, and its STL is up to date
- **THEN** `assemble()` imports the STL (`import_stl`) instead of inlining
  the SCAD model, and queued operations are applied after the import

#### Scenario: An up-to-date leaf is not rendered

- **WHEN** a rigid optimizing leaf's artifact is up to date and `assemble()` runs
- **THEN** the node's `render()` is not called and no CAD geometry is computed

#### Scenario: A stale leaf is rendered

- **WHEN** any file tracked for that leaf has changed since its artifact was written
- **THEN** `assemble()` renders the node and regenerates the artifact

#### Scenario: Simulate follows render

- **WHEN** an assembly defining both `render()` and `simulate()` is
  assembled
- **THEN** `render()` has run before `simulate()`, and the queued
  operations applied include those `simulate()` produced

#### Scenario: Every phase precedes the first geometry read

- **WHEN** a root with two subtrees is assembled
- **THEN** both subtrees' `simulate()` methods ran before the first
  subtree's geometry was composed, so a coordinate bound while the
  second subtree simulated still moves a body in the first

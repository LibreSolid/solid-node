## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The viewer evaluates flexible geometry per frame

The package SHALL bundle the molejo JavaScript evaluator and render a
document's `flexible` nodes: each node's `params` expressions are
evaluated in the same scope as operation expressions (`$t` and the
nested driver map), and the resulting values are handed to the molejo
evaluator, which writes vertex data into buffers the viewer allocates
once per node and reuses — vertex count and ordering are declared by
the spec and never change at frame rate, so no reallocation occurs.

Re-evaluation SHALL be bounded the way operation re-evaluation already
is: a flexible node's geometry is recomputed only on frames where a
free variable of one of its `params` expressions changed, and driving
a driver named by no `params` expression SHALL NOT re-evaluate it.

The loader SHALL accept documents declaring `version: 2` or
`version: 3`, and SHALL refuse — naming the node and the technology —
a `flexible` node whose `tech` the package cannot evaluate, rather
than rendering a wrong or missing shape.

The binding seam SHALL be pinned by the producer-generated parity
fixture: at least one case evaluates a real flexible document's
parameter expression client-side, feeds it to the bundled molejo
evaluator, and matches the producer's Python-side evaluation of the
same spec and binding within the fixture's tolerance. (Vertex-level
agreement between the two molejo evaluators is molejo's own parity
contract; what this package pins is the expression-to-parameter
binding in front of it.)

#### Scenario: A spring animates in the browser

- **WHEN** a document containing a molejo spring whose `height`
  expression references a declared driver is mounted and that driver
  is driven
- **THEN** the spring's geometry re-evaluates into its existing
  buffers on the frames where the driver changed, with vertex count
  unchanged

#### Scenario: An unrelated driver does not touch the spring

- **WHEN** a driver named by no `params` expression of the spring
  changes
- **THEN** the spring's geometry is not re-evaluated that frame

#### Scenario: An unknown technology is refused loudly

- **WHEN** a document carries a `flexible` node whose `tech` the
  package cannot evaluate
- **THEN** loading fails naming the node and the technology, and no
  wrong shape is rendered

#### Scenario: The binding parity case pins the seam

- **WHEN** the widget test suite runs the parity fixture's flexible
  binding case against the shipped evaluator and bundled molejo
- **THEN** the client-side parameter value and resulting evaluation
  agree with the producer-computed expectation within the declared
  tolerance

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The viewer declares its API version

The package SHALL declare one API version, expose it on every mount handle and
the browser global, and make it readable without executing the bundle. It SHALL
be raised whenever the mount interface or handle changes incompatibly, and when
a capability a host may require is added to the handle. The declared version
SHALL be 5, reflecting the addition of flexible-geometry rendering. (The
previous baseline text recorded 3 while the shipped package declared 4 — the
driver-driving capability was raised in code without this spec syncing; this
revision records the correction alongside the new capability.)

#### Scenario: A host checks compatibility before mounting

- **WHEN** a host reads the installed viewer API version
- **THEN** it obtains the package's single declared version without running a
  browser bundle

#### Scenario: A mounted viewer reports its version

- **WHEN** a host inspects a mount handle or the browser global
- **THEN** both report the same declared API version

#### Scenario: A host requires targeted updates

- **WHEN** a host needs `artifactChanged()` and `manifestChanged()`
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

#### Scenario: A host requires camera orientation control

- **WHEN** a host needs to supply an up direction and field of view
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

#### Scenario: A host requires flexible geometry

- **WHEN** a host needs `version: 3` documents rendered
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the capability is
  available

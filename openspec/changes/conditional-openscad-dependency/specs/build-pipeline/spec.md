## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Asynchronous STL render protocol

The system SHALL launch OpenSCAD renders as subprocesses
(`openscad <scad> -o <stl> --export-format binstl`) signalled by raising
`StlRenderStart`, which carries the process, target file, mtime, and lock
file. `build_stls()` SHALL loop, waiting on each started render
(`job.wait()`), until no renders remain; finishing a render stamps the STL
mtime and removes the lock. Non-rigid nodes SHALL be skipped.

This protocol is one of the paths that require the OpenSCAD binary under the
`openscad-dependency` capability. Before launching the subprocess for a node
the system SHALL confirm the binary is available and, when it is not, SHALL
fail naming that node and why its backend needs OpenSCAD, rather than letting
the subprocess launch fail. A build that reaches no such node SHALL make no
availability check.

A `FusionNode` whose subtree is exact SHALL NOT use this protocol. It composes
its own geometry under the `exact-geometry` capability and SHALL produce its
`.stl` by tessellating that composition in process, stamping the mtime as any
other artifact producer does, without launching a subprocess and without
raising `StlRenderStart`. A fusion with any non-exact descendant keeps the
subprocess protocol unchanged.

Tessellation of an exact composition SHALL use the same deflection the
`CadQueryNode` adapter already uses for leaf STL export, so a fused solid's
mesh is of the same quality as the leaves around it.

#### Scenario: Full build

- **WHEN** `build_stls()` runs on a tree with several stale rigid nodes
- **THEN** each stale STL is rendered exactly once and the call returns with
  all locks removed and mtimes stamped

#### Scenario: An exact fusion renders in process

- **WHEN** a `FusionNode` whose subtree is exact is built
- **THEN** its `.stl` is produced by tessellating its own composition, no
  OpenSCAD subprocess is launched for it, and `build_stls()` returns without
  waiting on a render job for that node

#### Scenario: A faceted fusion keeps the subprocess protocol

- **WHEN** a `FusionNode` holding a non-exact descendant is built
- **THEN** its STL is rendered by an OpenSCAD subprocess signalled by
  `StlRenderStart`, as before

#### Scenario: The renderer is missing for a node that needs it

- **WHEN** a stale mesh-backend node must be rendered and no `openscad` is on
  the PATH
- **THEN** the build fails naming that node and the reason its backend needs
  OpenSCAD, and no subprocess launch error surfaces in its place

#### Scenario: An all-exact build makes no availability check

- **WHEN** `build_stls()` completes for a tree whose every rigid node is exact
- **THEN** no OpenSCAD availability check is performed and the absence of the
  binary is never reported

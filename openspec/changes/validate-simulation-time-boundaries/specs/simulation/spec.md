## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Instructions carry design-unit targets

The system SHALL let an assembly declare named instructions:
`Instruction(targets, duration)` with targets keyed by driver name and
expressed in design units. An instruction duration SHALL be a finite real
number of seconds greater than or equal to zero. Instructions declared on any
node in the tree SHALL be discoverable and triggerable through the simulation
by qualified name — the declaring node's instance path joined with the
instruction name, with root-declared instructions keeping their bare names —
and each instruction's local target names SHALL resolve to the declaring
node's qualified driver ids. Triggering an instruction SHALL convert each
target to native driver state through that driver's declared scale (rounding
to the nearest native unit for an integer-typed driver; a driver with no scale
takes the target verbatim) and start a ramp program over the instruction's
duration. A zero-duration instruction SHALL reach every target and bind the
complete node snapshot immediately at the current tick, without advancing the
clock or adding a trajectory entry. Triggering an unknown name SHALL fail
listing the known qualified instruction names. Instruction semantics are held
to target-plus-duration linear ramps; sequencing and richer programs are
explicitly out of scope.

#### Scenario: Millimetre target reaches a microstep driver

- **WHEN** an instruction targets `x=0` (mm) for a driver declared
  with `scale` millimetres-per-microstep and dtype `int`
- **THEN** the ramp's native target is 0 microsteps and intermediate
  states are whole microsteps

#### Scenario: A child's instruction homes only that child

- **WHEN** both axis instances declare `'Home': Instruction({'motor':
  0.0}, duration=2.0)` and the scenario triggers `x_axis.Home`
- **THEN** only `x_axis.motor` ramps to its native target while
  `y_axis.motor` holds its state

#### Scenario: A zero-duration instruction settles now

- **WHEN** an instruction with duration zero is triggered at tick 20
- **THEN** its targets are immediately visible in `sim.state`, the bound node,
  and a later deferred action at tick 20
- **AND** the simulation remains at tick 20 with no new trajectory entry

#### Scenario: An invalid instruction duration is refused

- **WHEN** an instruction is declared with a negative, infinite, NaN,
  boolean, or non-numeric duration
- **THEN** construction raises `ValueError` naming the duration

### Requirement: Fixed-dt stepping loop with deferred actions

The system SHALL provide a simulation loop constructed over one assembly and
a fixed `dt`, which SHALL be a finite real number of seconds strictly greater
than zero and SHALL be validated before any node state is bound. On
construction it SHALL enumerate declared drivers across the whole linked tree
and bind every driver's default through `set_state` by qualified id, so a
state-consuming assembly — including one whose drivers live only on
descendants — renders under a complete snapshot from the first render. Each
tick SHALL: advance every driver's program, bind the full snapshot via
`set_state` together with the global `time` entry set to the exact simulation
instant in seconds (`k*dt`, computed from the integer tick count, never
accumulated), record the tick and snapshot in a trajectory keyed by qualified
id, then run due deferred actions and cadence actions. Under a running
simulation, `self.time` therefore reads the stepped simulation clock; the
normalized symbolic `$t` animation path outside simulations is unchanged.

Instants, cadence periods, and run durations SHALL be finite real seconds and
SHALL be validated as whole numbers of ticks (`round(t/dt)*dt == t` within
float tolerance), represented as integer tick counts rather than accumulated
floats. `run(duration)` SHALL require a nonnegative duration and SHALL reject
an invalid duration before firing actions or changing simulation state.
`at(t)` SHALL treat `t` as an absolute instant, reject a tick before the
current simulation tick, and accept the current tick, whose actions run in the
existing pre-step phase of the next `run()` including `run(0)`. Scheduled
actions SHALL be deferred callables — `at(t).trigger(name)` and
`at(t).run(fn)` where `fn` receives the simulation — never eagerly evaluated
expressions. `every(period, fn, *args)` SHALL require a positive period of at
least one whole tick, run `fn` at the declared tick cadence, and account its
cost per slot, so scenario reports can state assertion cost separately from
stepping cost.

#### Scenario: Non-whole instants are rejected

- **WHEN** `at(0.05)` is requested on a simulation with `dt=0.02`
- **THEN** the call fails naming the instant and `dt`

#### Scenario: Defaults bind before first render

- **WHEN** a simulation is constructed over an assembly whose
  `render()` reads a declared driver
- **THEN** construction succeeds with the declared default bound, with
  no unbound-state error

#### Scenario: A driverless root with driver-declaring children simulates

- **WHEN** a simulation is constructed over a root declaring no
  drivers whose two children each declare `motor`
- **THEN** construction binds both children's defaults under
  `x_axis.motor` and `y_axis.motor` and stepping addresses each
  independently

#### Scenario: Time reads the simulation clock

- **WHEN** a simulation with `dt=0.02` has advanced 125 ticks and a
  deferred action reads the assembly's `time`
- **THEN** the value is exactly the instant 2.5 seconds, not symbolic
  `$t` and not a normalized fraction

#### Scenario: Deferred action sees stepped state

- **WHEN** `at(2.5).run(fn)` is registered and the simulation runs
  past 2.5
- **THEN** `fn` is called once, at tick `2.5/dt`, observing the state
  after that tick's binding

#### Scenario: Invalid dt is refused before binding

- **WHEN** `Sim(node, dt)` receives zero, a negative value, infinity, NaN,
  a boolean, or a non-numeric value
- **THEN** construction raises `ValueError` naming `dt`
- **AND** the node has not received a simulation state binding

#### Scenario: Negative run duration has no effects

- **WHEN** a simulation with a current-tick action calls `run(-dt)`
- **THEN** `ValueError` is raised and its tick, state, trajectory, pending
  actions, and cadence counts are unchanged

#### Scenario: Past scheduling is refused

- **WHEN** a simulation at tick 10 registers an action for tick 9
- **THEN** `ValueError` is raised naming the instant and current time
- **AND** no action is registered or executed

#### Scenario: Current-tick scheduling remains valid

- **WHEN** a simulation at tick 10 registers an action for tick 10 and calls
  `run(0)`
- **THEN** that action runs once at tick 10 without adding a trajectory entry

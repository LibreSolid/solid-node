## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A host mounts the viewer and receives a handle
The viewer SHALL mount into a caller-supplied container against a published tree
document and resolve to a handle. The handle SHALL expose `dispose()` (stop
rendering, release resources and empty the container), `view()` (camera position
and orbit target), `reload()` (rebuild the document while preserving the view),
`artifactChanged(path)` and `manifestChanged()` (update only what changed),
assembly inspection and navigation operations, and the declared API version.
Loading the viewer core SHALL NOT modify the document; only an explicit mount
may do so.

#### Scenario: A host unmounts a viewer

- **WHEN** a host calls `dispose()`
- **THEN** rendering stops, the container is empty, and no later frame or
  resize callback runs

#### Scenario: A host remounts and keeps the maker's viewpoint

- **WHEN** a host captures `view()`, disposes, and supplies that view to a new
  mount
- **THEN** the new viewer uses the captured camera and orbit target rather
  than fitting again

#### Scenario: A host refreshes a changed model in place

- **WHEN** a source document changes and the host calls `reload()`
- **THEN** the new tree renders while camera position and orbit target remain
  unchanged

#### Scenario: Loading the core mounts nothing

- **WHEN** a host loads the core without calling `mount()`
- **THEN** no element is created, document fetched, or container modified

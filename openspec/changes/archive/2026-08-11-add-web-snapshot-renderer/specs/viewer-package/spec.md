## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The camera fits the model unless the host restores a view

The viewer SHALL orient Z-up and, after meshes load, fit the model bounds with
orbit controls targeting its centre. A supplied view SHALL set position and
target instead, while near and far clipping continue to derive from bounds. A
host MAY additionally supply an up direction and a field of view; absent either,
the viewer SHALL keep its own Z-up orientation and default field of view, so a
host that supplies neither sees no change.

#### Scenario: A first look at a model

- **WHEN** a model mounts without a view
- **THEN** the whole model is framed and orbiting targets its centre

#### Scenario: A rebuild during a work session

- **WHEN** a model mounts with a supplied view
- **THEN** the camera is restored and the model is neither clipped nor beyond
  the far plane

#### Scenario: A host reproduces another renderer's framing

- **WHEN** a host mounts with a view, an up direction, and a field of view
- **THEN** the model is seen from that viewpoint, rolled to that up direction,
  and framed at that field of view

#### Scenario: An existing host is unaffected

- **WHEN** a host mounts without an up direction or field of view
- **THEN** the viewer frames the model exactly as it did before those options
  existed

### Requirement: The viewer declares its API version

The package SHALL declare one API version, expose it on every mount handle and
the browser global, and make it readable without executing the bundle. It SHALL
be raised whenever the mount interface or handle changes incompatibly, and when
a capability a host may require is added to the handle. The declared version
SHALL be 3, reflecting the addition of host-supplied up direction and field of
view.

#### Scenario: A host checks compatibility before mounting

- **WHEN** a host reads the installed viewer API version
- **THEN** it obtains the package's single declared version without running a
  browser bundle

#### Scenario: A mounted viewer reports its version

- **WHEN** a host inspects a mount handle or the browser global
- **THEN** both report the same declared API version

#### Scenario: A host requires targeted updates

- **WHEN** a host needs `artifactChanged()` and `manifestChanged()`
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

#### Scenario: A host requires camera orientation control

- **WHEN** a host needs to supply an up direction and field of view
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

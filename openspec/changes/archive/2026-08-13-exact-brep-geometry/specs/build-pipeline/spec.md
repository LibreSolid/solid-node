## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Build artifact layout

The system SHALL write build artifacts under `$SOLID_BUILD_DIR` (default
`_build`), mirroring the source file's directory, with basename
`<script-name>-<uniq_id>`. Artifacts per node: `.scad` (base geometry,
no transforms), `.stl` (rendered), and `.stl.lock` during rendering. A node
that is exact under the `exact-geometry` capability SHALL additionally write
`.brep`, holding that node's unplaced exact geometry under the same basename.
World-space spatial math does not use on-disk artifacts — the `mesh`
property loads the plain `.stl` and applies operations in memory (the
`.mesh.scad`/`.mesh.stl` path attributes exist but are vestigial; nothing
writes or reads them). The build path SHALL be an ordinary directory that every
builder writes into directly; the system SHALL NOT publish through a symlink, a
versioned sibling directory, or a private candidate copy. A build path left as
a symlink by an earlier layout SHALL be converted to an ordinary directory
holding the artifacts it referenced.

The `.brep` artifact SHALL be private to the build. No viewer snapshot, export
manifest, or other published document SHALL reference it, and its presence
SHALL NOT alter any document's schema.

#### Scenario: Custom build dir

- **WHEN** `SOLID_BUILD_DIR` is set in the environment
- **THEN** all artifacts, and `errors.json`, are written under that
  directory instead of `_build`

#### Scenario: Consumer reads through the build path

- **WHEN** a consumer opens the published viewer snapshot at the build path
- **THEN** it reads the snapshot without resolving a symlink or naming any
  other directory

#### Scenario: Project published under the previous layout

- **WHEN** a project whose build path is a symlink to a versioned directory is
  built
- **THEN** the build path becomes an ordinary directory holding those
  artifacts, and the versioned siblings are removed

#### Scenario: An exact node writes exact geometry beside its mesh

- **WHEN** an exact rigid node is built
- **THEN** a `.brep` artifact sits beside its `.stl` under the same basename

#### Scenario: A faceted node writes no exact artifact

- **WHEN** a rigid node that is not exact is built
- **THEN** no `.brep` artifact is written for it

#### Scenario: Published documents do not name exact geometry

- **WHEN** a build publishes its viewer snapshot for a project of exact nodes
- **THEN** the document references only `.stl` models and names no `.brep`

### Requirement: Mtime-equality caching

The system SHALL treat an artifact as up to date iff it exists AND its mtime
equals the node's `mtime`, where `node.mtime` is the maximum source-file
mtime across all files tracked for the node (`node.files`, aggregated
recursively from children). After generating an artifact the system SHALL
back-date its mtime to the source mtime via `os.utime` so the equality holds.
A change to any contributing source file invalidates all ancestor artifacts.

For an exact node the `.brep` artifact SHALL participate in this rule exactly
as the `.stl` does: the node's artifacts are current only when both are, so a
node whose mesh is current but whose exact geometry is absent or stale SHALL
be rendered rather than skipped. A build directory produced before the node
became exact therefore reports not-current once and is rebuilt.

A node's tracked files SHALL include its own source together with the
project-local modules that source imports, transitively. Modules outside the
project tree SHALL NOT be tracked. Where the contributing set cannot be
determined exactly, the system SHALL track more files rather than fewer, so
that an uncertain dependency causes an unnecessary rebuild rather than a stale
artifact.

#### Scenario: Source edit invalidates ancestors

- **WHEN** a leaf's source file is modified
- **THEN** the leaf's STL and every ancestor STL report not-up-to-date and
  are regenerated on the next build

#### Scenario: Imported project module edit invalidates dependants

- **WHEN** a node's source imports a project module that defines no node, and
  that module is modified
- **THEN** the node's artifact reports not-up-to-date and is regenerated with
  the new values on the next build

#### Scenario: A library change does not invalidate

- **WHEN** a node imports a module from outside the project tree
- **THEN** that module is not part of the node's tracked files

#### Scenario: Unchanged sources skip rendering

- **WHEN** `generate_stl` runs and the STL mtime equals `node.mtime`
- **THEN** no OpenSCAD process is launched

#### Scenario: Missing exact geometry is not current

- **WHEN** an exact node's `.stl` and `.scad` are current but its `.brep` is
  absent
- **THEN** the node reports not-up-to-date and is rendered, producing both

### Requirement: Asynchronous STL render protocol

The system SHALL launch OpenSCAD renders as subprocesses
(`openscad <scad> -o <stl> --export-format binstl`) signalled by raising
`StlRenderStart`, which carries the process, target file, mtime, and lock
file. `build_stls()` SHALL loop, waiting on each started render
(`job.wait()`), until no renders remain; finishing a render stamps the STL
mtime and removes the lock. Non-rigid nodes SHALL be skipped.

A `FusionNode` whose subtree is exact SHALL NOT use this protocol. It composes
its own geometry under the `exact-geometry` capability and SHALL produce its
`.stl` by tessellating that composition in process, stamping the mtime as any
other artifact producer does, without launching a subprocess and without
raising `StlRenderStart`. A fusion with any non-exact descendant keeps the
subprocess protocol unchanged.

Tessellation of an exact composition SHALL use the same deflection the
`CadQueryNode` adapter already uses for leaf STL export, so a fused solid's
mesh is of the same quality as the leaves around it.

#### Scenario: Full build

- **WHEN** `build_stls()` runs on a tree with several stale rigid nodes
- **THEN** each stale STL is rendered exactly once and the call returns with
  all locks removed and mtimes stamped

#### Scenario: An exact fusion renders in process

- **WHEN** a `FusionNode` whose subtree is exact is built
- **THEN** its `.stl` is produced by tessellating its own composition, no
  OpenSCAD subprocess is launched for it, and `build_stls()` returns without
  waiting on a render job for that node

#### Scenario: A faceted fusion keeps the subprocess protocol

- **WHEN** a `FusionNode` holding a non-exact descendant is built
- **THEN** its STL is rendered by an OpenSCAD subprocess signalled by
  `StlRenderStart`, as before

### Requirement: A successful build sweeps unreferenced artifacts

After a successful publication the system SHALL remove files in the build
directory that the current viewer snapshot does not reference, other than the
snapshot, the error file, `.scad` inputs, `.brep` exact geometry, live render
lock files, and temporaries belonging to a build in progress. The sweep SHALL
be confined to the build directory.

`.brep` artifacts are spared by kind rather than by reference, because no
published document names them. As with `.scad` inputs, a superseded one is
therefore not removed by the sweep; mtime-equality caching means a superseded
artifact is never read.

#### Scenario: A renamed node leaves nothing behind

- **WHEN** a node is renamed and the project is rebuilt successfully
- **THEN** the artifact under the old name is gone from the build directory and
  the artifact under the new name is present and referenced

#### Scenario: A failed build sweeps nothing

- **WHEN** a build fails
- **THEN** no artifact is removed from the build directory

#### Scenario: Exact geometry survives the sweep

- **WHEN** a build of exact nodes publishes successfully and sweeps
- **THEN** every `.brep` written for a current node is still present, though
  the published snapshot names none of them

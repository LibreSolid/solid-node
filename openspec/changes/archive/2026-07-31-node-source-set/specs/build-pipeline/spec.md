## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mtime-equality caching

The system SHALL treat an artifact as up to date iff it exists AND its mtime
equals the node's `mtime`, where `node.mtime` is the maximum source-file
mtime across all files tracked for the node (`node.files`, aggregated
recursively from children). After generating an artifact the system SHALL
back-date its mtime to the source mtime via `os.utime` so the equality holds.
A change to any contributing source file invalidates all ancestor artifacts.

A node's tracked files SHALL include its own source together with the
project-local modules that source imports, transitively. Modules outside the
project tree SHALL NOT be tracked. Where the contributing set cannot be
determined exactly, the system SHALL track more files rather than fewer, so
that an uncertain dependency causes an unnecessary rebuild rather than a stale
artifact.

#### Scenario: Source edit invalidates ancestors

- **WHEN** a leaf's source file is modified
- **THEN** the leaf's STL and every ancestor STL report not-up-to-date and
  are regenerated on the next build

#### Scenario: Imported project module edit invalidates dependants

- **WHEN** a node's source imports a project module that defines no node, and
  that module is modified
- **THEN** the node's artifact reports not-up-to-date and is regenerated with
  the new values on the next build

#### Scenario: A library change does not invalidate

- **WHEN** a node imports a module from outside the project tree
- **THEN** that module is not part of the node's tracked files

#### Scenario: Unchanged sources skip rendering

- **WHEN** `generate_stl` runs and the STL mtime equals `node.mtime`
- **THEN** no OpenSCAD process is launched
